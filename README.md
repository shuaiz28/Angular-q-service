# Angular-q-service
Angular provides $q service to deal with promises. It allows us to work with asychronous functions and use their returned values when they are done.

Promise:
- is an assurance that we will get a result form an action in the future.
- 2 possible results:
  1). fulfilled (got the response, whether good or bad)
  2). rejected (didn't get the response)
- we need promise because we need to make decisions based on the possible results.
